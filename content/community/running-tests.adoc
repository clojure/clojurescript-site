On macOS download a http://webkit.org[WebKit nightly] and put it in your
Applications folder. Update your shell profile to include the following:

[source,bash]

DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/Applications/WebKit.app/Contents/Frameworks/10.12/
export DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH

_NOTE:_ Sub in the correct macOS version if you're not running `10.12`

[[nashorn]]

Setup the `$NASHORN_HOME` environment variable so that
