[[testing-the-compiler-infrastructure]]
== Testing the Compiler Infrastructure

[source,bash]
----
lein test
----

Will run the tests for the analyzer, compiler, and closure components.

[[testing-javascript-engines]]
== Testing JavaScript Engines

How to setup the important JavaScript runtimes.

[[google-v8]]
=== Google V8

Follow https://v8.dev/docs/build[Google V8 checkout and build instructions].

Set the V8_HOME environment variable to the path where https://v8.dev/docs/d8[d8] was built, for example:

`export V8_HOME="$HOME/v8/out/x64.release"`

Verify via:

`echo quit | $V8_HOME/d8`

[[spidermonkey]]
=== Mozilla SpiderMonkey

Get the JavaScript shell (jsshell) from
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/.
Set your SPIDERMONKEY_HOME environment variable to installation location.

Verify via:

`$SPIDERMONKEY_HOME/js --version`

[[javascriptcore]]
=== WebKit JavaScriptCore

On macOS we test with JavaScriptCore. JavaScriptCore (jsc) should be on your system, but needs to
be added to your `PATH` environment variable so that it will be found, for example:

`export PATH="$PATH:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/A/Resources"`

Verify that `jsc` brings up a prompt.


[[nashorn]]
=== Java Nashorn

Setup the `$NASHORN_HOME` environment variable so that

`$NASHORN_HOME/jjs`

prompts a JavaScript Console. Nashorn is usually under `$JAVA_HOME/bin`,
so you can write:

`export NASHORN_HOME="$JAVA_HOME/bin"`

Verify via:

`echo 'quit()' | $NASHORN_HOME/jjs -fv`

[[graalvm]]
=== Oracle GraalVM

Get GraalVM from http://www.graalvm.org.
Set your GRAALVM_HOME environment variable so that `$GRAALVM_HOME/js` executes Graal.js.

Verify via:

`$GRAALVM_HOME/js --version`


[[chakracore]]
=== Microsoft ChakraCore

Get ChakraCore from https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/releases.
Set your CHAKRACORE_HOME environment variable so that `$CHAKRACORE_HOME/ch` executes ChakraCore.

Verify via:

`$CHAKRACORE_HOME/ch -version`

[[setting-up-dependencies]]
=== Setting up dependencies

[source,bash]
----
./script/bootstrap
----

[[running-the-tests]]
=== Running the tests

[source,bash]
----
./script/test
----

Will run tests for each JavaScript runtime that you setup as described above, runtimes that you did not setup will be skipped.

[[running-bootstrapped-clojurescript-tests]]
=== Running bootstrapped ClojureScript tests

If you have Node.js installed, you can run the bootstrapped
ClojureScript test suite (located at
`src/test/self/self_host/test.cljs`):

[source,bash]
----
./script/test-self-host
----

You can also build and run the ClojureScript compiler test suite in
bootstrapped mode within Node.js by running

[source,bash]
----
./script/test-self-parity
----

[[running-clojurescript-cli-tests]]
=== Running ClojureScript CLI (`cljs.main`) tests

You can run tests exercising the ClojureScript CLI by running

[source,bash]
----
./script/test-cli repl-env [repl-env-opts-edn]
----

where `repl-env` is any of the built-in REPL environments (`node`, `browser`, _etc._). This will be passed to `cljs.main` 's `-re` option.

Note that testing with `graaljs` REPL environment requires GRAALVM_HOME to be found early in your PATH. You can test via:
[source,bash]
----
(export PATH="$GRAALVM_HOME:$PATH"; ./script/test-cli graaljs)
----

You can also specify a non-built-in REPL environment, but you would have to revise `script/test-cli` to include the downstream REPL environment on the classpath. You can also pass optional `repl-env-opts-edn`, which will be passed to `cljs.main` 's `-ro` option.

[[dont-forget]]
=== Don't forget

Besides the tests it's important to make sure that the Browser REPL
hasn't accidentally been broken. Double-check using the sample found in
the repository.
