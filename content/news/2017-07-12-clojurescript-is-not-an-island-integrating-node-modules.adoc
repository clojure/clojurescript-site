This is the second post in the
https://clojurescript.org/news/2017-07-07-sneak-preview[Sneak Preview] series.

ClojureScript has had first class JavaScript interop since its initial release
in 2011. Similarly to Clojure, embracing the host has always been an explicit goal.
While the above is true from a syntax standpoint, integrating with external
JavaScript libraries historically came at the cost of some manual work footnote:[aside
from the https://developers.google.com/closure/library/[Google Closure Library]
which was deeply integrated since ClojureScript's initial release.]
(https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options#foreign-libs[manually assembled]
bundles or packaging led by http://github.com/cljsjs/packages[community efforts]).

=== A step towards better interaction with external JavaScript

The 2015 Google Summer of Code project for ClojureScript succeeded in making the
interaction with  easier. Relying on the https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/[Google Closure Compiler]'s
then new ability to understand most widely known JavaScript module formats and
convert them to Closure compatible JavaScript footnote:[the subset of JavaScript
that the Closure Compiler needs to perform optimizations such as dead code elimination
(tree shaking), variable name rewriting, constant folding and inlining, among others.],
https://github.com/MNeise[Maria Geller] successfully integrated those module features
into ClojureScript, along with https://clojurescript.org/guides/javascript-modules#babel-transforms[custom preprocessing]
steps that allow using features such as the popular JavaScript compilation technology
http://babeljs.io/[Babel] from the comfort of your ClojureScript project
footnote:[Maria also kept a regular blog whilst working on that project that you
can read http://mneise.github.io/[here].].

Since then, the Closure Compiler team added module _resolution_ support in 2016,
which among other things enables consuming modules directly from a `node_modules`
installation instead of having to feed Closure handcrafted module paths for conversion.

== Seamless interaction with NPM dependencies

We have built on Maria's modules work to account for this new Closure feature, and
the next release of ClojureScript represents yet another major milestone in making
arbitrary JavaScript modules accessible to every ClojureScript project by including
substantial improvements to the way that ClojureScript interoperates with the NPM
ecosystem.

https://anmonteiro.com/2017/03/requiring-node-js-modules-from-clojurescript-namespaces/[Requiring NPM modules from ClojureScript namespaces]
has been possible since ClojureScript version 1.9.518. However, Node.js supports
multiple patterns for requiring CommonJS modules, and a common painpoint was people
looking to require modules of the form `"react-dom/server"` from ClojureScript, which
would not be a valid symbol for the `:require` spec.

In this release, we added support for string-based requires in the namespace form
to solve the above problem. You can now require these types of modules from the
comfort of your `ns` declaration.

Gluing it all together is the `:npm-deps` compiler flag. In it, we tell the compiler
which dependencies it should be aware of. ClojureScript will take care of installing
those dependencies and running them through the Closure Compiler conversion.

=== A practical example

Given a `build.clj` file like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[cljs.build.api :as b])

(b/build "src"
  {:output-dir "out"
   :output-to "out/main.js"
   :optimizations :none
   :main 'example.core
   :npm-deps {:react "15.6.1"
              :react-dom "15.6.1"}})
----

Your simplest `src/example/core.cljs` file could look like the snippet below:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns example.core
  (:require [react :refer [createElement]]
            ["react-dom/server" :as ReactDOMServer :refer [renderToString]]))

(js/console.log (renderToString (createElement "div" nil "Hello World!")))
----

Notice we don't have to declare `"react-dom/server"` anywhere. We can just require
it. ClojureScript is now smart enough to find these CommonJS modules and process
them into Google Closure Compiler compatible code.

== This is a big deal

The implications of consuming JavaScript modules with Google Closure are huge: the
external libraries used in a ClojureScript project are no longer just prepended to
the generated bundle, but can now be subjected to all of Closure Compiler's optimizations,
including dead code elimination and, in projects that take advantage of
https://clojurescript.org/news/2017-07-10-code-splitting[code splitting], cross
module code motion. For example, in our tests React is appreciable smaller (~16%)
under Closure's advanced compilation than it would be using existing popular JavaScript
tooling. Additionally, if you have a mixed codebase of ClojureScript and JavaScript,
not only can you now seamlessly consume those JavaScript portions of your code
(including e.g. JSX transformations!), but also share and bundle their vendor
dependencies with the ones your ClojureScript part uses.

=== Works on Node.js too!

It's worth noting that the module processing feature in ClojureScript is mostly
intended to be used in projects that target the browser, where dependencies will
normally be bundled together. But that doesn't mean projects targeting Node.js can't
also take advantage of this feature. In fact, we made it so that you can also seamlessly
require Node modules in a local `node_modules` installation from your namespace
declaration when targeting Node.js. ClojureScript will know that you're requiring
a Node module and produce a `require` declaration, integrating with Node.js's own
facilities for loading JavaScript modules.

== Parting thoughts

ClojureScript is, after almost 6 years, a platform relied upon by a great number of
developers worldwide, and we want to continue to deliver on full interoperability
with the host. By making sure that we integrate with the vast JavaScript ecosystem
out there, we think these new features arriving in the next version of ClojureScript
are a stepping stone in assuring ClojureScript's sustainability long term.

We hope you enjoy these new features as much as we do. Thanks for reading!
