## Noteworthy Changes

Spec instrumentation no longer requires a dependency on `clojure.test.check`. To
enable data generation by `clojure.test.check`, e.g. by using `stest/check`, you
now need to manually require `clojure.test.check`.

Keywords used in the `cljs.spec.test.alpha/check` API pertaining to Spec's use
of `test.check` are now qualified with `clojure.spec.test.check, thus aligning
with Clojure. The old way of qualifying with `clojure.test.check` is still
supported.  

## Clojure 1.10 Features

### Improved Exception Messages and Printing

The https://www.clojure.org/reference/repl_and_main#_error_printing[improved exception infrastructure] added in Clojure 1.10
has been ported to ClojureScript with this release.

### Protocol via Metadata

The ability to add protocols via metadata (for protocols defined with 
the `:extend-via-metadata true` directive) has been ported to ClojureScript 
with this release.

### Datafy and Nav

The `clojure.datafy` namespace has been ported to ClojureScript,
along with associated protocols in the `clojure.core.protocols` namespace.

## Type Inference Improvements

### Predicate-Induced Type Inference

The type inference algorithm will now consider core predicates in when
inferring the types of locals used in conditional expressions.

For example, in

[source,clojure]
----
(if (string? x)
  (inc x)
  10)
----

because `x` satisfies `string?`, it will be inferred to be of string type
in the then branch (and thus cause a warning to be emitted because `inc`
is being applied to it).

Because `cond` and `when` are macros built on top of `if`, predicate-induced
inference also works as expected for expressions involving `cond` and `when`.

In addition to core predicates, predicte-induced type inference also works
for `instance?` checks. So, for example testing `(instance? Atom x)` will
result in `x` to be inferred to be of type `cljs.core/Atom`.

### Truthy-Induced Inference

In situations where a value could potentially be `nil` (represented by the
symbol `clj-nil` in type tags), if a simple symbol referring to such a value
is used as the test in a conditional, the type inference algorithm will
infer that the value cannot be `nil` in the then branch.

This is perhaps best illustrated by way of example. Let's say you have 
the following function:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn f [x]
  (when (even? x)
    (inc x)))
----

This function's return type is `#{number clj-nil}`, meaning that the
either a number of `nil` can be returned.

The following function, which uses `f` and would previously be inferred as
returning `#{number clj-nil}`, is now inferred as returning `number`:

[source,clojure]
----
(defn g [y] 
  (let [z (f y)] 
    (if z
      z
      17)))
----

In fact, owing to the way the `or` macro expands, the expression
`(or (f 1) 17)` is now inferred as being simply `number`.

### Improved `loop` / `recur` Inference

The type-inferrence algorithm will now consider `recur` parameter types
when inferring `loop` local types.

For example, in

[source,clojure]
----
(loop [x "a"]
  (if (= "a" x)
   (recur 1)
   (+ 3 x)))
----

the local `x` would previously be inferred to be of string type (and
this would cause a warning to be emitted for the expression adding it
to `3`). Now, the compiler will infer `x` to be either string or numeric
(and thus the warning will no longer appear).

### Multi-Arity and Variadic Function Return Type Inference

ClojureScript 1.10.439 added https://clojurescript.org/news/news#_function_return_type_inference[function return type inference], but this capability
only worked for single-arity functions. This release extends this capability
to multi-arity and variadic functions.

In particular, the inferred return type will properly vary if different
arities return different types. For example, 

[source,clojure]
----
(defn foo
  ([x] 1)
  ([x y] "a"))
----

then the expression `(foo true)` will be inferred to be of numeric type
while `(foo :a :b)` will be inferred to be of string type.

## Spec Improvements

Several improvements in the Spec implementation are in this release, making it
easier to spec functions in the standard core library, as well as improving
instrumentation performance when a large number of functions in a codebase
have specs.

## Improved Performance

### Chunked-Seq support for Ranges

ClojureScript now supports chunked-seqs for ranges. An example where this
capability improves performance is

[source,clojure]
----
(reduce + (map inc (map inc (range (* 1024 1024)))))
----

which is evaluated 5 times faster in V8, 7 times in SpiderMonkey, and 2 times
in JavaScriptCore.

### Optimized String Expression Concatenation

Generally, arguments supplied to the `str` function are first coerced
to strings and then concatenated. With this release, unnecessary
coercion is eliminated for arguments that are inferred to be of string
type.

For example, in

[source,clojure]
----
(defn foo [x y]
  (str (+ x y)))

(str (name :foo/bar) "-" (foo 3 2))
----

the last `str` expression is evaluated 3 times faster in V8 and 4 times
faster in JavaSriptCore as a result of the improved codgen.
