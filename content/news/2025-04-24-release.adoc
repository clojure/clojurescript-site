We're happy to announce a new release of ClojureScript. If you're an
existing user of ClojureScript please read over the following release
notes carefully.

This release features two significant dependency changes. First,
Google Closure Compiler has been updated to `v20250402`. This change
makes Java 21 a requirement for ClojureScript. The other significant
change is that this release now depends on the Clojure fork of Google
Closure Library. Please read on for more details about these changes.

For a complete list of fixes, changes, and enhancements to
ClojureScript see

## Google Closure Compiler & Java 21

Last year we noted that updating Google Closure Compiler would mean
losing Java 8 support. Google Closure now requires Java 21. From our
perspective this change doesn't seem strictly necessary, but Google
is a large organization and this change is probably to due to internal
concerns which are hard to influence from the outside.

So far, the burden of staying current with Google Closure has been
manageable. If some reason that calculus changes, we could adopt
the strategy we have taken with Google Closure Library.

## Clojure's Fork of Google Closure Library

Google stopped contributing to Google Closure Library (GCL) last August. As far
as ClojureScript is concerned, the stability of certain critical portions of
GCL had declined significantly over the past 5 years. Google was clearly trying
many things with respect to their internal JavaScript strategy, and this churn
surfaced in the stability of the library. Google stopping GCL development
removes a consistent source of unexpected surprises between releases.

We have forked Google Closure Library and have taken up maintenance. The very
first changes made were simply backing out previously commited breaking changes,
and aligning the codebase with the latest Google Closure Compiler release.

One of the biggest benefits of GCL is that it makes ClojureScript a complete
solution for writing ClojureScript for a variety of JavaScript contexts. You
don't need to deal with Node modules, build tools, and various flavors of the
month.
