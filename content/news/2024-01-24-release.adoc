We're happy to announce a new release of ClojureScript. If you're an existing
user of ClojureScript please read over the following release notes carefully.

This is primarily a bugfix release.

For a complete list of fixes, changes, and enhancements to ClojureScript see
https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/changes.md#1.11.132[here]

## Google Closure Compiler & Java 8

This will probably be the last ClojureScript release to support Java 8 as Google
Closure Compiler now requires Java 11.

## Google Closure Library Maintenance Mode & ClojureScript

Google has https://groups.google.com/g/closure-library-discuss/c/FijyNE6_kt4[stopped developing Google Closure Library].
What does this mean for the future of ClojureScript? Not a whole lot. Google
Closure Library is a project distinct from the Compiler that provides a large
set of reusable battle-tested libraries that are Closure-compatible. As browsers
and the JavaScript ecosystem have evolved this project has become less
important to Google.

Google is not going to remove Google Closure Library (GCL), remove the API
docs, or doing anything that would be detrimental to ClojureScript. Note that
Google stopped providing regular releases many years ago - ClojureScript uses an
artifact that we release ourselves. Even if Google did remove GCL from the
Internet, we could still continue to provide the artifact and docs ourselves.

The standard library, `cljs.core`, uses GCL in relatively simple ways, most of
which could be replaced easily. This will likely happen over time and community
contributions are welcome in this effort.

The various built-in REPLs (Browser, Node) use a bit more GCL functionality and
could also be evolved gradually over time.

None of the above changes that we generate Google Closure Compiler compatible
JavaScript and will continue to do so. Google itself embraced the wider
JavaScript ecosystem, but they also transpile everything into Google Closure Compiler
compatible JS (via https://github.com/angular/tsickle[tsickle]) before finally
processing it with Google Closure Compiler.

As always, we do not believe in creating meaningless churn for users. You can continue
to rely on GCL in its current form for years. You can expect various base
GCL namespaces (`goog.string`, `goog.object`, etc.) to be available as before.

Looking towards the future, it is worth assessing Google's approach with tsickle
to get the benefits of Closure advanced compilation without losing the ease
provided by the JavaScript ecosystem.
