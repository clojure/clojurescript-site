## Noteworthy Changes

* The behavior of `set/union` and `into` is now aligned with Clojure.
* `subvec` argument checking is now aligned with Clojure.
* `apply` `vector` on an array now properly clones the array.

## Google Closure Namespace Analysis

The compiler now produces analysis metadata for Google Closure namespaces.
This means that for these namespaces:

* REPL facilities like `doc`, `dir`, `apropos`, _etc._, will now work.
* Argument lists are available, thus enabling arity checking.
* Return types are available, enhancing type inference.
* Warnings on private var usage will be generated.

To illustrate, let's `(require '[goog.crypt :as crypt])` and explore it 
at the REPL:

Now, `(dir crypt)` will list the functions in that namespace:

----
byteArrayToHex
byteArrayToString
hexToByteArray
...
----


Docstrings are available; `(doc crypt/hexToByteArray)` produces:

----
-------------------------
goog.crypt/hexToByteArray
([hexString])
  /**
 * Converts a hex string into an integer array.
...
----

Arity information is available. Passing an incorrect argument count to one
of the functions, produces an arity warning. For example,
`(crypt/hexToByteArray "abc" 123)` generates:

----
WARNING: Wrong number of args (2) passed to goog.crypt/hexToByteArray at line 1 <cljs repl>
----

## Type Inference Improvements

Several improvements to ClojureScript's type inference are in this release.

### Direct field access for keyword lookup on records

This is easily explained by way of example:

[source,clojure]
----
(defrecord Complex [re im])

(let [x (->Complex 1.1 2.7)]
   (:re x))
----

The code generated for the last expression will be `x.re`. This can be 
anywhere between 66% and 450% faster.

### `count` specializations for string and array

If you apply `count` to a value that is statically inferred to be
either a string or an array, the JavaScript generated will
involve direct access to the `length` field instead of a runtime
call to `count`.

For example `(count "abc")` will cause `"abc".length` to be emitted.
Depending on context, this could be several orders of magnitude faster.

### `simple-*` / `qualified-*` predicate-induced inference

If `simple-keyword?` or `qualified-keyword?` is satisfied for a
local then that local is inferred to be a keyword. Similarly
`simple-symbol?` or `qualified-symbol?` results in a local being
as a symbol.

This essentially broadens the existing predicate-induced inferrence
for `keyword?` and `symbol?` to these additional core predicates.

### Thread predicate-induced inference through `and`

This type inference improvement is perhaps best explained by way
of an example. For the following code

[source,clojure]
----
(and (string? x) (zero? (count x)))
----

the compiler will now know that, if the first clause in the `and` above
is satisfied, then, in the second clause, `x` must be of type string.
Combined with the `count` specialization mentioned above, this causes
efficient JavaScript to be generated:

[source,javascript]
----
typeof x === "string" && x.length === 0
----

### Not inferring on `implements?`

This is an internal, yet important, optimization for the standard library: 
When the `implements?` predicate is satisfied on a local, the compiler 
generates more efficient function dispatch code for expressions involving 
that local.

### Improperly widened cross-param `loop` / `recur` inference

A corner-case involving `loop` / `recur` widening inference was fixed where
incorrect inferrence can occur if a `loop`-bound local is used as a `recur`
target.

### Dynamic Vars are now properly inferred as having type `any`

An inference bug was fixed where dynamic Vars were incorrectly inferred
as having the type of their initialization value. This was incorrect
because dynamic Vars can be re-bound at runtime with values of types
that differ from the initialization value type.

## Performance Improvements

### Optimize `assoc` on `IAssociative` values

An optimization in the core `assoc` function makes it faster when `assoc` ing
onto `IAssociative` values (the common case).

For example, `assoc` ing a key-value onto a map can be 24% faster in V8 and
11% faster in JavaScript core, a great perf boost for this frequently
used core function.

### Tag `coll` as `not-native` in `ci-reduce`

This is an important internal optimization affecting the standard library
which improves performance when reducing collections which are `IIndexed`
and `ICounted`.

### Improve perf of `cljs.source-map.base64/encode`

This improves the performance of a function heavily used in the generation
of source maps, improving the performance by 17% in one of our measurements.
