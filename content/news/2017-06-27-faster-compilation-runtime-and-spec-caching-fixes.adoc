Several exciting performance enhancements are in the ClojureScript 1.9.660
release. Some improvements speed up the compiler itself, others optimize the code
generated by the compiler, and yet others fine tune data structures and common
operations upon them.

## Compiler Performance

With two small changes the compiler now compiles ClojureScript code much faster.
Users have reported 20â€“40% faster compile times.

Don't forget to try `:parallel-build`, which is not enabled by default. This can
further cut your compile times in half.

## Code Performance

* `:^const` Var values are now inlined
* `sort`, `shuffle` is now 30-40% faster (thanks to `to-array` optimization)
* `apply` is 200-400% faster
* `defmulti` is now much faster in the case of a miss (200-1000%)
* set and map equivalence is 100-200% faster
* `reduce` on sets and maps is now ~100% faster

## Correctness

Many correctness fixes have been made, several of them bringing ClojureScript
more in line with Clojure behavior. Other important fixes were made with respect
to compilation caching; notably code defining Specs now works properly when
caching is enabled.

> *NOTE*: that this release introduces a new warning for incorrect code which
> employs variadic signatures in protocol method implementations. Such code will
> continue to work with this release. Be sure to update any code or libraries that
> make use of this construct so that protocol implementations match some existing
> signature.

## New Features

* A new `resolve` macro - like Clojure's but at compile-time
* Modules support wildcard namespaces
* New Closure language options `:es-2017`, `:es-next`
* A new compiler option `:fn-invoke-direct` (a futher optimization extension to `:static-fns`)
* You can use `js/Promise` and many more ES features and have Google Closure Compiler generate polyfills (`:rewrite-polyfills` compiler option)

You should definitely give this release a try on your code to see how it
performs! We hope you enjoy this release!
