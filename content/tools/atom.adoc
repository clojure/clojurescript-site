== How to Install Atom Packages

You can bring up your Atom settings by pressing `Command + ,` (command + comma)
or `Control + ,` (control + comma) on Windows. From there, you can go to the
"Install" tab and search for the name of the package you'd like to install. If
you prefer using the command line, you can also use `apm` to install packages
using:

----
$ apm install [package-name]
----

[[parinfer]]
== Parinfer

Unlike Java and Javascript, the convention in ClojureScript is to place closing
delimiters on the same line instead of on a new line. To help manage this,
Shaun LeBron's https://atom.io/packages/parinfer[Parinfer] can automatically
balance your closing delimiters based on your code's indentation. Chris
Oakman's Atom package for Parinfer can be found here:
https://atom.io/packages/parinfer

[[indentation]]
== Improved Newline Auto-Indentation

Atom, by default, does not auto-indent newlines correctly for Lisp dialects. You
can solve this by installing Jon Spalding's
https://atom.io/packages/lisp-paredit[lisp-paredit] Atom package. If
you're already using Parinfer and only want to use the lisp-paredit package for
newline indentation, you can change lisp-paredit's settings to:

* Enabled: checked
* Strict: unchecked
* Keybindings Enable: unchecked

...and update your `keymap.cson` file with the following keybindings:

----
# Provides proper indentation when enter is pressed
'atom-text-editor[data-grammar~="clojure"]':
  'enter': 'lisp-paredit:newline'

# Override newline back to original when in Proto-REPL console
# GitHub Issue: https://github.com/jonspalding/lisp-paredit/issues/26
'ink-console atom-text-editor[data-grammar~="clojure"]':
  'enter': 'editor:newline'
----

NOTE: The `keymap.cson` file is found in the main menu under "Atom > Keymap...".

[[linters]]
== Joker Linter

Roman Bataev's https://github.com/candid82/joker[Joker] linter can let you know
when you've made an error in some code that you've written. Ryan De La Torre's
Atom package for Joker can be found here: https://atom.io/packages/linter-joker

[[proto-repl]]
== Proto REPL

Jason Gilman's https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl[Proto REPL] allows you to
evaluate ClojureScript code from your editor.

=== Setting Up Proto REPL with Figwheel

If you're using Leiningen and Figwheel, the quickest way to connect Proto REPL
to your application is to launch Figwheel from within Proto REPL. To do this,
first merge `figwheel-sidecar`, `piggieback`, and `proto-repl` into your dev
dependencies in your `project.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[figwheel-sidecar "0.5.9"]
                                [com.cemerick/piggieback "0.2.1"]
                                [proto-repl "0.3.1"]]
----

Next, add `piggieback`'s nREPL middleware for ClojureScript:

[source,clojure]
----
:repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [cemerick.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]}
----

Now open Proto REPL. You can do this by pressing `Command + Shift + P` (or
`Control + Shift + P` on Windows) to bring up the Command Palette, then using
the Command Palette to search for the `Proto REPL: Toggle` command.

After starting Proto REPL, you should see the message, "Starting REPL with lein
in [path to your project]" at the bottom of the REPL instructions. If all went
well, you should be able to run the following command in Proto REPL to start
Figwheel and start a ClojureScript REPL:

[source,clojure]
----
(do (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api) (start-figwheel!) (cljs-repl))
----

Open your locally-hosted webpage in a browser, then try typing some test code
into Proto REPL, such as `(js/alert "Hello from Proto REPL!")` to verify that
everything is working. (The above command should cause an alert to appear in
your browser.)

=== Saving Commands to Proto REPL

If you don't want to type the command to start Figwheel every time, you can save
a custom command to your Atom's `init.js`/`init.coffee` file:

----
atom.commands.add('atom-text-editor', 'Start Figwheel with CLJS REPL', function () {
  protoRepl.executeCode(`
    (when
      (try
        (require 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
        (resolve 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/start-figwheel!)
        (catch Throwable _))
      (eval '(do (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/start-figwheel!)
                 (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/cljs-repl))))
  `);
});
----
