= Testing

ClojureScript now ships with a port of `clojure.test` in the form of
`cljs.test`. It attempts to preserve most of the functionality provided
by `clojure.test` along with enhancements for asynchronous testing in a
single threaded environment.

Most of the functionality is provided via macros as `cljs.test` relies
on compiler reflection and static vars to provide most of its
functionality.

For example your testing ns form will probably look something like the
following:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-project.tests
  (:require-macros [cljs.test :refer [deftest is are testing]]))
----

[[writing-tests]]
=== Writing Tests

You can write tests with `cljs.test/deftest` and `cljs.test/is` same as
with `clojure.test`.

For example here is a trivial test with one assertion:

[source,clojure]
----
(deftest test-numbers
  (is (= 1 1)))
----

[[running-tests]]
=== Running Tests

You can run tests by using the `cljs.test/run-tests` macro. This may be
done in your REPL or at the end of your file. If you have many test
namespaces it's idiomatic to create a test runner namespace which
imports all of your test namespaces and then invokes `run-tests`.

You may have to add `(enable-console-print!)` before calling `run-tests`

[[fixtures]]
=== Fixtures

You can declare fixtures with the `cljs.test/use-fixtures` macro. You
can declare either `:once` fixtures or `:each` fixtures. `:once`
fixtures are run only around all tests within a namespace. `:each`
fixtures are run around each test. Unlike `clojure.test` fixtures are
split into two parts `:before` and `:after`. This is so that fixtures
will work correctly even when used asynchronously.

[source,clojure]
----
(use-fixtures :once
  {:before (fn [] ...)
   :after  (fn [] ...)})
----

[[async-testing]]
=== Async Testing

As client-side code tends to be highly asynchronous and JavaScript is
single-threaded, it's important that `cljs.test` provide asynchronous
testing support. You can use the `cljs.test/async` macro to create an
asynchronous block. If you write an asynchronous test the last value you
return _must_ be the async block.

[source,clojure]
----
(deftest test-async
  (async done
    (http/get "http://foo.com/api.edn"
      (fn [res]
        (is (= res :awesome))
        (done)))))
----

`done` is a function that you may invoke when you are ready to
relinquish control and allow the next test to run. `done` can be called
anything, but it probably makes sense to keep to the convention. All of
your testing code must be in the async block. If you launch multiple
asychronous processes in your async block you will need to coordinate
them. This is a good reason to use `cljs.core.async`:

[source,clojure]
----
(deftest test-async
  (let [url0 "http://foo.com/api.edn"
        url1 "http://bar.com/api.edn"
        res0 (http/get url0)
        res1 (http/get url1)]
    (async done
      (go
        (is (= (<! res0) :awesome))
        (is (= (<! res1) :cool))
        (done)))))
----

*NOTE:* You cannot have more than one async test per `deftest` form or
only the first one will run.

Bad:

[source,clojure]
----
(deftest test-async
  (testing "the API is awesome" ; <-- only this test will run
    (let [url "http://foo.com/api.edn"
          res (http/get url)]
      (async done
        (go
          (is (= (<! res) :awesome))
          (done)))))
    (testing "the API is cool"
      (let [url "http://bar.com/api.edn"
            res (http/get url)]
        (async done
          (go
            (is (= (<! res1) :cool))
            (done))))))
----

Good:

[source,clojure]
----
(deftest test-async-awesome
  (testing "the API is awesome"
    (let [url "http://foo.com/api.edn"
          res (http/get url)]
      (async done
        (go
          (is (= (<! res) :awesome))
          (done))))))

(deftest test-async-cool
  (testing "the API is cool"
    (let [url "http://bar.com/api.edn"
          res (http/get url)]
      (async done
        (go
          (is (= (<! res1) :cool))
          (done))))))
----

[[async-fixtures]]
=== Async Fixtures

Often establishing your testing environment means you need your fixtures
to be asynchronous too. This is easily accomplished:

[source,clojure]
----
(use-fixtures :once
  {:before
   #(async done
      ...
      (done))
   :after
   #(do ...)})
----

In this case `:before` will need to complete before any test can run.
`:after` will complete immediately after all tests have run since it
does not use an async block.

[[detecting-test-completion-success]]
=== Detecting Test Completion & Success

Often it's useful to be able to run some code after all tests have
completed successfully (or unsuccessfully). Because tests may run async
`cljs.test/run-tests` does not return a meaningful value. You can
however add a test report event listener by adding a method to the
`cljs.test/report` multimethod.

[source,clojure]
----
(defmethod cljs.test/report [:cljs.test/default :end-run-tests] [m]
  (if (cljs.test/successful? m)
    (println "Success!")
    (println "FAIL")))
----
