> **NOTE**: This guide uses the master branch of ClojureScript. Clone
ClojureScript and from the checkout run `./script/bootstrap` and
`./script/uberjar`. This will produce `target/cljs.jar` which you can use to
follow this guide.

As client applications become larger it becomes desirable to load only the code
actually required to run a particular logical screen. Previously ClojureScript
`:modules` compiler option permitted such code splitting, but this feature only
worked under `:advanced` compilation and users would still have to manage
loading these splits. `:modules` also required manual explicit placement of many
entries to produce optimal splits otherwise dependencies would get moved to
`:cljs-base`.

All of these issues are now addressed directly in ClojureScript. This guide will
walk you through code splitting a simple project and demonstrate these new
enhancements.

=== Make a Simple Project

Create a project folder:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir -p hello-modules
cd hello-modules
mkdir src
```

Copy the `cljs.jar` into this directory.

Create a REPL script:

[source,bash]
```
touch repl.clj
```

Edit this script to look like the following:

[source,clojure]
```
(require '[cljs.repl :as r])
(require '[cljs.build.api :as b])
(require '[cljs.repl.browser :as rb])

(def opts
  {:watch "src"
   :output-dir "out"
   :asset-path "/out"
   :optimizations :none
   :modules {:foo {:entries '#{foo.core}
                   :output-to "out/foo.js"}
             :bar {:entries '#{bar.core}
                   :output-to "out/bar.js"}}
   :browser-repl true
   :verbose true})

(b/build "src" opts)
(r/repl* (rb/repl-env) opts)
```

Now make an `index.html` file:

[source,html]
```
<html>
    <body>
         <button id="button">Load Bar!</button>
         <script src="out/cljs_base.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
         <script src="out/foo.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

=== The Sources

Create the `foo.core` namespace:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir -p src/foo
touch src/foo/core.cljs
```

Edit this file to look like the following:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core
  (:require [goog.dom :as gdom]
            [goog.events :as events]
            [cljs.loader :as loader])
  (:import [goog.events EventType]))

(enable-console-print!)

(println "I'm foo!")

(events/listen (gdom/getElement "button") EventType.CLICK
  (fn [e]
    (loader/load :bar
      (fn []
        ((resolve 'bar.core/woz))))))
```

Notice the unfamiliar namespace `cljs.loader`. This namespace provides a Google
Closure ModuleManager singleton to manage the loading of code splits. This
manager will be initialized with whatever module graph you have defined in
`:modules`.

When the user clicks the button we load the `:bar` module and invoke a function
that exists in the `bar.core` namespace. Notice that we use `resolve`. This is
because we cannot directly call something we never required. If we tried to do
this without `resolve` the ClojureScript compiler would emit an undeclared var
warning during compilation.

Create the `bar.core` namespace:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir -p src/bar
touch src/bar/core.clj
```
[source,clojure]

```
(ns bar.core
  (:require [cljs.loader :as loader]))

(enable-console-print!)

(println "I'm bar!")

(defn woz []
  (println "WOZ!"))
```

=== Build the Project

Run the REPL script:

[source,bash]
```
rlwrap java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main repl.clj
```

You will be prompted to connect via browser. Navigate to
http://localhost:9000/index.html.

Click the button. You will see that the `:bar` module gets loaded and the
function in the other namespace gets invoked.

=== Release Builds

Make a new script `release.clj`:

[source,bash]
```
touch release.clj
```

Make it look like the following:

[source,clojure]
```
(require '[cljs.build.api :as b])

(b/build "src"
  {:output-dir "out"
   :asset-path "/out"
   :optimizations :advanced
   :verbose true
   :modules {:foo {:entries '#{foo.core}
                   :output-to "out/foo.js"}
             :bar {:entries '#{bar.core}
                   :output-to "out/bar.js"}}})

(System/exit 0)
```

Build your project:

[source,bash]
```
java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main release.clj
```

Start a browser REPL just for serving content from current directory:

[source,bash]
```
java -jar cljs.jar -m cljs.repl.browser
```

Navigate to http://localhost:9000/index.html. Your application should function
correctly even though advanced compiled.

Change the `foo.core` to take a new require like `cljs.reader`. Rebuild.

You should see that `cljs.reader` gets moved into the `:foo` module but not
`:bar`.

If you examine the split files in `out` you will see that `foo.js` is larger
than `bar.js`.
