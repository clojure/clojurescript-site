*This guide requires ClojureScript 1.10.238 or later and assumes
familiarity with the <<xref/../../guides/quick-start#,Quick Start>>*.

As client applications become larger it becomes desirable to load only the code
actually required to run a particular logical screen. Previously ClojureScript
`:modules` compiler option permitted such code splitting, but this feature only
worked under `:advanced` compilation and users would still have to manage
loading these splits. `:modules` also required manual explicit placement of many
entries to produce optimal splits otherwise dependencies would get moved to
`:cljs-base`.

All of these issues are now addressed directly in ClojureScript. This guide will
walk you through code splitting a simple project and demonstrate these new
enhancements.

=== Make a Simple Project

Create a project folder:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir -p hello-modules
cd hello-modules
mkdir src
```

Create a `deps.edn` file that looks like the following:

[source,clojure]
```
{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.11.54"}}}
```

Create a `build.edn` file that looks like the following:

[source,clojure]
```
{:output-dir "out"
 :asset-path "/out"
 :browser-repl false
 :modules {:foo {:entries #{foo.core}
                 :output-to "out/foo.js"}
           :bar {:entries #{bar.core}
                 :output-to "out/bar.js"}}}
```

Now make an `index.html` file:

[source,html]
```
<html>
    <body>
         <button id="button">Load Bar!</button>
         <script src="out/cljs_base.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
         <script src="out/foo.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

=== The Sources

Create the `foo.core` namespace:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir -p src/foo
touch src/foo/core.cljs
```

Edit this file to look like the following:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core
  (:require [goog.dom :as gdom]
            [goog.events :as events]
            [cljs.loader :as loader])
  (:import [goog.events EventType]))

(println "I'm foo!")

(events/listen (gdom/getElement "button") EventType.CLICK
  (fn [e]
    (loader/load :bar
      (fn []
        ((resolve 'bar.core/woz))))))

(loader/set-loaded! :foo)
```

Notice the unfamiliar namespace `cljs.loader`. This namespace provides a Google
Closure ModuleManager singleton to manage the loading of code splits. This
manager will be initialized with whatever module graph you have defined in
`:modules`.

When the user clicks the button we load the `:bar` module and invoke a function
that exists in the `bar.core` namespace. Notice that we use `resolve`. This is
because we cannot directly call something we never required. If we tried to do
this without `resolve` the ClojureScript compiler would emit an undeclared var
warning during compilation.

Finally, note that it is necessary to manually mark a module as loaded via
`cljs.loader/set-loaded!`. Without this dependencies may be loaded multiple
times which may lead to unpredictable behavior.

Create the `bar.core` namespace:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir -p src/bar
touch src/bar/core.cljs
```
[source,clojure]

```
(ns bar.core
  (:require [cljs.loader :as loader]))

(println "I'm bar!")

(defn woz []
  (println "WOZ!"))

(loader/set-loaded! :bar)
```

=== Build the Project

Build your project and start the builtin HTTP server:

[source,bash]
```
clj -M -m cljs.main -v -co build.edn -c -s
```

Navigate to http://localhost:9000/index.html.

Click the button. You will see that the `:bar` module gets loaded and the
function in the other namespace gets invoked.

=== Release Builds

Build your project:

[source,bash]
```
clj -M -m cljs.main -co build.edn -O advanced -c -s
```

Navigate to http://localhost:9000/index.html. Your application should function
correctly even though advanced compiled.

Change the `foo.core` to take a new require like `cljs.reader`. Rebuild.

You should see that `cljs.reader` gets moved into the `:foo` module but not
`:bar`.

If you examine the split files in `out` you will see that `foo.js` is larger
than `bar.js`.

=== Additional Notes

Because the code in splits is running in JavaScript's global scope, sometimes it
may interfere with other JavaScript loaded on the same page (i.e. analytics),
which may result in unpredictable behaviour. If this is a problem for your
application prefix all variables in generated JavaScript by specifiyng
`:rename-prefix` compiler option.
