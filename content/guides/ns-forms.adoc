The ClojureScript `ns` form can, in most usage, be quite simple and similar to Clojure, especially with affordances that have been recently added to ClojureScript.

But, there is a rich set of options that underlie the `ns` form and you may encounter their use in the wild. This guide aims to walk through these options and provide some clarity.

# Macros

In ClojureScript, macros are handled a bit differently than in Clojure. In particular, the `ns` form supports `:require-macros`, along with some simplifying sugar and implicit loading behavior that we will cover here.

## Primitives

For the sake of an example, let's assume that we have the following in `src/foo/core.clj`:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core)

(defmacro add
  [a b]
  `(+ ~a ~b))
```

To use this macro in some ClojureScript source, you can employ the `:require-macros` spec as

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require-macros [foo.core]))

(foo.core/add 2 3)
```

Now, `:require-macros` is designed to work a lot like `:require`. So, for example, you could directly refer the `add` symbol into your namespace:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require-macros [foo.core :refer [add]]))

(add 2 3)
```

> An alternative to the above (which is infrequently seen, but worth covering for completeness), is `:use-macros`. In ClojureScript `:require` / `:refer` and `:use` / `:only` are essentially dual forms of each other. So, the `ns` form in the above could have just as well been written `(ns bar.core (:use-macros [foo.core :only [add]]))`.

You could also set up a namespace alias `foo`:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require-macros [foo.core :as foo]))

(foo/add 2 3)
```

## Sugar

The examples above are all making use of the `:require-macros` primitive.

Frequently, though, you will be consuming code that comes from a library that offers both runtime code (functions and other `def` s) and macros, all from the same namespace.

So, continuing on our example, let's say that there is a `src/foo/core.cljs` file with

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core)

(defn subtract
  [a b]
  (- a b))
```

Now if you wanted to use both add and subtract, you might do something like this:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require-macros [foo.core :refer [add]])
  (:require [foo.core :refer [subtract]]))

(add 2 3)
(subtract 7 4)
```

But, there is a bit of `ns`-form sugar, `:refer-macros` that lets you write instead:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require [foo.core :refer [subtract] :refer-macros [add]]))

(add 2 3)
(subtract 7 4)
```

The `:refer-macros` above really is just sugar, and it is algorithmically desugared into the previous form by the compiler.

Similarly, there is `:include-macros` sugar that you can use to signal that the macros namespace should be required using the same specifications as the runtime namespace. So for example, this works:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require [foo.core :as foo :include-macros true]))

(foo/add 2 3)
(foo/subtract 7 4)
```

The above desugars into the more repetitively verbose primitive form:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require-macros [foo.core :as foo])
  (:require [foo.core :as foo]))

(foo/add 2 3)
(foo/subtract 7 4)
```

## Implicit Sugar

In cases where a runtime namespace being required _internally_ requires its own macro namespace (meaning a namespace with the same name), then you implicitly get the `:include-macros` sugar for free.

To illustrate this, let's say our `src/foo/core.cljs` file instead looked like this:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core
  (:require-macros foo.core))

(defn subtract
  [a b]
  (- a b))
```

Now, you can consume things like this:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require [foo.core :as foo]))

(foo/add 2 3)
(foo/subtract 7 4)
```

## Implicit Refer

What about this nice-looking simplification?

[source,clojure]
```
(ns bar.core
  (:require [foo.core :refer [add subtract]))

(add 2 3)
(subtract 7 4)
```

In this case, the fact that `add` is a macro and that `subtract` is a function is automatically handled by the compiler, thus making it possible to uniformly refer vars, with the `ns` form looking essentially like it would in Clojure.

## Docs

If you are ever at a REPL and need a quick reference to the above topics, the docstring for the `ns` special form is there to help. The sugared forms are referred to as _inline macro specification_ and the implicit sugar is referred to as _implicit macro loading_. A fairly comprehensive example of desugaring is included in the docstring. In a pinch, `(doc ns)` is your friend.

## The `require` and `require-macros` macros

You can use `require` and `require-macros` to dynamically load code into your REPL. What's interesting is that the capability described above also works for these macros.

This is an implementation detail, but it helps you see how this is accomplished: When you issue

[source,clojure]
```
(require-macros '[foo.core :as foo :refer [add]])
```

at the REPL, this is internally converted into an `ns` form that looks like

[source,clojure]
```
(ns cljs.user
  (:require-macros [foo.core :as foo :refer [add]]))
```

And, importantly, when you use `require`, a similar `ns` form is employed, and it is subject to all the desugaring and inference behavior described above.

# `clojure` Namespace Aliasing

Some namespaces—like `clojure.string` and `clojure.set`—are available for use in ClojureScript, even though the first segment in those namespaces is `clojure`. But then others—like `cljs.pprint`, `cljs.test`, and  now `cljs.spec`—live under `cljs`.

Why the difference? Ideally, there'd be none. But, if you look at, say, the port of `clojure.pprint` for use with ClojureScript, it involves a _macro_ namespace. This is where the problem lies. Since the JVM ClojureScript compiler uses Clojure for execution, there would be a namespace collision if the port were not moved to `cljs.pprint`. In short, the `clojure.pprint` namespace was taken.

A consequence of this is that we have to remember to use `cljs.*` for some namespaces when writing ClojureScript. And, if you are writing portable code, you need to employ reader conditionals.

There is a relatively new simplification to the `ns` form that you can employ: You can use `clojure` in lieu of `cljs` in the first segment of namespaces in the case of nonexistent `clojure.\*` namespaces that can be mapped to `cljs.*` namespaces.

A simple example:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core
  (:require [clojure.test]))
```

can be used instead of

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core
  (:require [cljs.test]))
```

If you do this, the ClojureScript compiler will first see if it can load the `clojure.test` namespace. Since it doesn't exist, it will fall back to loading `cljs.test`.

At the same time, an alias is set up from `clojure.test` to `cljs.test`, as if you had written:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core
  (:require [cljs.test :as clojure.test]))
```

This is important because it allows you to have code that qualifies symbols, as in `clojure.test/test-var`.


With this aliasing, along with the ability to infer macro vars in `:refer` specs (see “Implicit Refer” above), the following code works just fine in ClojureScript:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns foo.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :as test :refer [deftest is]]))

(deftest foo-test
  (is (= 3 4)))

(test/test-var #'foo-test)
```

And, more importantly: _This is the exact same code you'd write in Clojure_. No reader conditionals needed!

Of course, this also works in the `require` ClojureScript macro. So for example, you can do:

[source,clojure]
```
(require '[clojure.spec :as s])
```

Then `(s/def ::even? (s/and number? even?))` will work just fine. The reason for this is that the `require` macro is implemented in terms of the `ns` special.

## Summary

Hopefully these detailed examples help clarify how `ns` desugaring, inference, and aliasing work. The overall intent is to simplify ClojureScript `ns` form usage, but unpacking how these extra capabilities work leads to a better understanding for those times when you either want or need to know what is really going on.

Making good use of these capabilities should go a long way towards easing the differences between ClojureScript and Clojure `ns` forms.
