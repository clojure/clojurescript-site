The only dependencies required for this tutorial are an installation of
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java
8] and the
https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/releases/download/r1.9.473/cljs.jar[standalone
ClojureScript JAR]. ClojureScript itself only requires Java 7 but the
standalone JAR comes bundled with useful
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html[Nashorn]
integration that requires Java 8.

You must have Java 8 installed to proceed.

Even if you are interested in a http://leiningen.org[Leiningen],
http://boot-clj.com[Boot],
https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel[Figwheel], or
https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html[Maven] based workflow this
Quick Start is essential reading. It covers the fundamentals regardless
of what tooling you decide to end up using.

[[clojurescript-compiler]]
=== ClojureScript Compiler

The standalone ClojureScript JAR bundles https://clojure.org[Clojure]
1.8.0. This supports simple scripting of the ClojureScript compiler and
the bundled REPLs without an overly complicated command line interface.

[NOTE]
====
**Debug Note**: If you use `curl` to download the JAR, be sure to
specify the `-L` flag to follow redirects. (Otherwise you'll end up with
an HTML page of
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28481272/clojurescript-error-could-not-find-or-load-main-class-clojure-main#comment47580543_28481272[about
300 bytes]) Make sure the file is not renamed by your browser, eg.
cljs(1).jar.
====

Create a directory `hello_world` and copy the JAR into that directory,
then from _inside_ the `hello_world` directory:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p src/hello_world;touch src/hello_world/core.cljs
----

For Windows:

[source,bash]
----
md src\hello_world & type nul >>core.cljs & move core.cljs src\hello_world
----

In your favorite text editor edit the `src/hello_world/core.cljs` to
look like the following:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.core)

(enable-console-print!)

(println "Hello world!")
----

First we declare our namespace. Every ClojureScript file must declare a
namespace and this namespace must match a path on disk. We then enable
direct printing to the commonly available JavaScript `console` object
and print the famous message.

In order to compile this we need a simple build script. ClojureScript is
just a Clojure library and can be easily scripted in a few lines of
__Clojure__. Create a file called `build.clj` next to the `src` directory
and the `cljs.jar` file. Note the name of this file does not matter. In
this tutorial we'll always make our compiler helper scripts at the root
of the project directory.

Add the following Clojure code:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.build.api)

(cljs.build.api/build "src" {:output-to "out/main.js"})
----

We `require` the `cljs.build.api` namespace. We then invoke the standard
function for building some ClojureScript source -
`cljs.build.api/build`. This function only takes two arguments: the
directory to compile and a map of options. In our case a simple
`:output-to` will suffice for now.

Let's build some ClojureScript:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main build.clj
----

On Windows:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp "cljs.jar;src" clojure.main build.clj
----

We invoke `java` and set the classpath to our JAR and the directory
where our ClojureScript code lives. The `clojure.main` argument in this
case allows us to easily execute a Clojure file.

[NOTE]
====
**Debug Note**: If you encounter an error about `cljs.build.api` not
being found, make sure that you didn't write
`(require 'cljs.build.api')`, many popular text editors will emit a
matching single quote even in their Clojure mode.
====

Control should return to the shell relatively quickly and you will have
an `out` directory with compiled JavaScript including your simple
program. You will see that many files were produced in addition to the
`out/main.js` we specified. We'll explain this momentarily but first
let's see how you can easily include the compiled output on a web page.

[[using-clojurescript-on-a-web-page]]
== Using ClojureScript on a Web Page

Create a file `index.html` at the root of the project and include the
following:

[source,html]
----
<html>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="out/main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
----

Open this file in your favorite browser and find the JavaScript
developer console so you can see the output. (Note that nothing will
appear in the main browser windowâ€”no content is being rendered.)

You will not see `"Hello world!"` but instead you will likely see an
error like the following:

[source,bash]
----
Uncaught ReferenceError: goog is not defined
----

In order to understand this error we must examine a few basics around
the Google Closure Library. While the following section may seem
somewhat roundabout, a short review on how Google Closure Library works
will make simple bugs considerably easier to spot.

[[google-closure-library]]
=== Google Closure Library

In order to abstract away JavaScript environment differences
ClojureScript relies on the
https://developers.google.com/closure/library/[Google Closure Library]
(GCL). GCL supplies an important facility missing from JavaScript:
namespaces and a way to declare dependencies between them. In fact
ClojureScript namespaces get compiled to Google Closure namespaces.

Loading dependencies correctly across various browser targets is a
surprisingly tricky affair. GCL accomplishes this by maintaining a
dependency graph. When you require a namespace it will write the needed
script tags in dependency order for you.

So what went wrong? If you look at `out/main.js` you will see some
dependency graph building calls:

[source,javascript]
----
goog.addDependency("base.js", ['goog'], []);
goog.addDependency("../cljs/core.js", ['cljs.core'], ...);
goog.addDependency("../hello_world/core.js", ['hello_world.core'], ...);
----

But wait, where is this `goog` object coming from?

Oops. We never loaded it! In order for GCL to bootstrap we must at least
load `goog/base.js`. You'll see this is available in `out/goog/base.js`.
Let's add this to your page now:

[source,html]
----
<html>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="out/goog/base.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="out/main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
----

Refresh the page.

The error will be gone but you still won't see the desired
`"Hello world!"`.

Hrm. `out/main.js` didn't appear to have any of the logic that we wrote,
in fact it only includes the needed dependency graph information for the
ClojureScript standard library `cljs.core` and our namespace.

Ah. The last step we missed was actually requiring our namespace to kick
things off. Change `index.html` to the following.

[source,html]
----
<html>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="out/goog/base.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="out/main.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            goog.require("hello_world.core");
            // Note the underscore "_"!
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
----

Refresh your `index.html` and you should finally see `"Hello world!"`
printing to the browser JavaScript console. If you're using a
sufficiently modern browser you should even see the printing was invoked
from a ClojureScript source file and not a JavaScript one thanks to
source mapping (some browsers like Chrome require you to first enable
source mapping, for more details
https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/source-maps[look
here]).

[[less-boilerplate]]
=== Less Boilerplate

The previous section explained some important fundamental concepts
around the Google Closure Library. However it also involved a
substantial amount of boilerplate. We can eliminate this boilerplate by
specifying a `:main` entry point in the options that we pass to
`cljs.build.api/build`. Let's do that now:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.build.api)

(cljs.build.api/build "src"
  {:main 'hello-world.core
   :output-to "out/main.js"})
----

Change your HTML to the following:

[source,html]
----
<html>
    <body>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="out/main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
----

Rebuild on Mac or GNU/Linux:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main build.clj
----

On Windows:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp "cljs.jar;src" clojure.main build.clj
----

Refresh the page and you should still see `"Hello world!"` printed to
the JavaScript console. If you examine `out/main.js` you'll see that it
writes out the boilerplate script tags for you. The previous contents of
`main.js` are now in `out/cljs_deps.js`, which is loaded alongside our
namespace by the new `out/main.js`.

[[auto-building]]
=== Auto-building

The ClojureScript compiler supports incremental compilation. It's
convenient to have the ClojureScript compiler watch a directory and
recompile as needed. Let's make a new helper script `watch.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.build.api)

(cljs.build.api/watch "src"
  {:main 'hello-world.core
   :output-to "out/main.js"})
----

Let's start auto building:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main watch.clj
----

You should see output like the following:

[source,bash]
----
Building ...
Reading analysis cache for jar:file:/.../cljs.jar!/cljs/core.cljs
Analyzing src/hello_world/core.cljs
... done. Elapsed 1.425505401 seconds
----

Edit `src/hello_world/core.cljs`. You should see recompilation output.

Terminate auto building (using `Ctrl-C`) before proceeding to the next
section.

[NOTE]
====
**Further Reading**: While not required for the remainder of the Quick
Start, it's highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with basics
of https://developers.google.com/closure/library/index[Google Closure
Library]. Many simple errors can be avoided by reinforcing your
understanding of how Closure Library works.
====

[[browser-repl]]
== Browser REPL

It's hard to imagine a productive Lisp experience without a REPL
(Read-Eval-Print-Loop). ClojureScript ships with builtin REPL support
for Node.js, Rhino, Nashorn, and browsers.

Let's hook up a browser REPL to our project.

First it is recommended (but not required) that you install
https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap[rlwrap]. Under OS X the easiest way is to use http://brew.sh[brew] and `brew install rlwrap`.

Let's create a REPL script `repl.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.repl)
(require 'cljs.build.api)
(require 'cljs.repl.browser)

(cljs.build.api/build "src"
  {:main 'hello-world.core
   :output-to "out/main.js"
   :browser-repl true
   :verbose true})

(cljs.repl/repl (cljs.repl.browser/repl-env)
  :watch "src"
  :output-dir "out")
----

We build the project at least once before constructing the REPL.

REPLs are always constructed in the same way. The first argument to
`cljs.repl/repl` is the REPL evaluation environment (Node.js, Rhino,
Nashorn, browser), the subsequent arguments are the same arguments you
pass to `cljs.build.api/build` in addition to several options that are
specific to REPLs. Note that we supply a `:watch` option with a source
directory. This conveniently starts a REPL along with an auto building
process. The auto building process will write its activity to
`out/watch.log` so you can easily `tail -f out/watch.log`. We also
specify `:output-dir` so that the REPL can reuse compiled files
generated by the build.

Let's try it:

[source,clojure]
----
java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main repl.clj
----
or
[source,clojure]
----
rlwrap java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main repl.clj
----

The first time will be somewhat slow as the REPL communication script
needs to build. You should eventually see the following message:

[source,bash]
----
Waiting for browser to connect ...
----

Point your web browser at http://localhost:9000.

You should get a REPL. (Note that the REPL will appear in your terminal,
not in the browser.)

Try evaluating a simple expression like `(+ 1 2)`.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Debug Note**: If the REPL doesn't connect immediately try refreshing
the browser a few times (Chrome & Firefox tend to be more stable than
Safari). Note that eval will be slow in some browsers if you don't have
the browser REPL tab focused. If for some reason the REPL completely
hangs, just refresh the page.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Run `tail -f out/watch.log` in a fresh terminal to view auto build
progress.

Try evaluating some expressions like `(first [1 2 3])`, or
`(doc first)`, `(source first)`.

Change your `src/hello_world/core.cljs` source file to look like the
following:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.core)

(enable-console-print!)

(println "Hello world!")

;; ADDED
(defn foo [a b]
  (+ a b))
----

At the REPL prompt, require your namespace by evaluating
`(require '[hello-world.core :as hello])`. Try evaluating
`(hello/foo 2 3)`, you should get the result `5`.

Change your source file so that `foo` uses `*` instead of `+`:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.core)

(enable-console-print!)

(println "Hello world!")

(defn foo [a b]
  (* a b)) ;; CHANGED
----

We can get this new definition in our REPL by appending a `:reload`
keyword to our require statement thereby forcing a reload. Evaluate
`(require '[hello-world.core :as hello] :reload)` and try
`(hello/foo 2 3)` you should get `6` this time.

Lets make a mistake. Try evaluating `(ffirst [1])`. You should get a
source mapped stack trace pointing at ClojureScript source locations not
JavaScript ones. This makes debugging a lot nicer.

[[production-builds]]
== Production Builds

You may have noticed that `out` contains a lot of JavaScript.
Fortunately the ClojureScript compiler generates output optimized for
the Google Closure Compiler. The Google Closure Compiler performs many
optimizations, but the most significant for browser-based clients are
minification and dead code elimination.

Let's make a new helper build script `release.clj`, it should look like
the following:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.build.api)

(cljs.build.api/build "src"
  {:output-to "out/main.js"
   :optimizations :advanced})

(System/exit 0)
----

Under `:advanced` optimizations `:main` is not needed as advanced
compilation creates a single JavaScript artifact. We also add a
`(System/exit 0)` as the Google Closure Compiler creates a thread pool
that isn't shutdown; since we know that we're done we can just exit.

Let's remove the dev time REPL bits from `src/hello_world/core.cljs`:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.core)

(enable-console-print!)

(println "Hello world!")
----

Let's create a release build:

[source,clojure]
----
java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main release.clj
----

This process will take significantly longer which is why we don't use
this compilation mode for development.

Open `index.html`, you should still see `"Hello world!"` printed.

Examine `out/main.js`, the file size should be around 80K. If you zip
this file you'll see that it's around 19K. This is significantly smaller
than a jQuery dependency yet when using ClojureScript you have implicit
dependencies on the entire ClojureScript standard library (10KLOC) and
the Google Closure Library (300KLOC). You can thank dead code
elimination.

[[running-clojurescript-on-node.js]]
== Running ClojureScript on Node.js

First install Node.js. For instructions on installing Node.js, see the
https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/README.md[Node.js wiki]. Only
the current stable versions of Node.js (>= `0.12.X`) are supported at
this time. Your `src/hello_world/core.cljs` should look like the
following:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require [cljs.nodejs :as nodejs]))

(nodejs/enable-util-print!)

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "Hello world!"))

(set! *main-cli-fn* -main)
----

Make a build helper file called `node.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.build.api)

(cljs.build.api/build "src"
  {:main 'hello-world.core
   :output-to "main.js"
   :target :nodejs})
----

The only differences are that we had to specify a `:nodejs` target and
we do not output `main.js` to the `out` directory. This is important due
to the way that Node.js resolves JavaScript source files.

Node.js has great source mapping support, in order to enable it just
install `source-map-support`:

[source,bash]
----
npm install source-map-support
----

Let's build your Node project:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main node.clj
----

You can run your file with:

[source,bash]
----
node main.js
----

[NOTE]
====
**Note**: Under Node.js there is little reason to use advanced
optimizations. While advanced optimizations does apply performance
related optimizations, these are now largely obviated by optimizations
present in modern JavaScript virtual machines like V8, SpiderMonkey, and
JavaScriptCore. For Node.js, `:simple` or `:none` optimizations suffice
and using them removes the need for extra steps like supplying an
externs file.
====

[[node.js-repl]]
=== Node.js REPL

Running a Node.js REPL is similar to running a browser REPL.
Create a helper build file called `node_repl.clj` that looks like the
following:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'cljs.repl)
(require 'cljs.build.api)
(require 'cljs.repl.node)

(cljs.build.api/build "src"
  {:main 'hello-world.core
   :output-to "out/main.js"
   :verbose true})

(cljs.repl/repl (cljs.repl.node/repl-env)
  :watch "src"
  :output-dir "out")
----

There's no need to add any REPL specific bits to
`src/hello_world/core.cljs`, make sure it looks as described in the
previous section.

Let's start the REPL:

[source,bash]
----
rlwrap java -cp cljs.jar:src clojure.main node_repl.clj
----

All the previously described REPL interactions for the browser should
work.

[[dependencies]]
== Dependencies

ClojureScript supports a wide variety of options for including
ClojureScript and JavaScript dependencies (see
<<xref/../../../reference/dependencies#,Dependencies>>
for details). However the simplest
approach is to include a properly packaged JAR on the classpath.
http://cljsjs.github.io[CLJSJS] provides a nice set of curated
JavaScript libraries that suffices to demonstrate how dependencies are
handled.

http://facebook.github.io/react/[React] is a popular dependency for
ClojureScript projects. http://cljsjs.github.io[CLJSJS] provides a
https://github.com/cljsjs/packages/tree/master/react[bundled version].
Let's see how to include it.

Grab the JAR from https://clojars.org[Clojars]:

[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://clojars.org/repo/cljsjs/react/0.12.2-8/react-0.12.2-8.jar
----

Let's edit our simple program to look like the following so that React
is properly required:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require cljsjs.react))

(enable-console-print!)

(println "Hello React!")
----

Let's rebuild our project, all we need to do is extend our classpath to
include the CLJSJS React JAR.

[source,bash]
----
java -cp cljs.jar:src:react-0.12.2-8.jar clojure.main build.clj
----

If you refresh your `index.html` page you should see the usual React log
indicating that React was successfully loaded.

If you have a few dependencies, one convention is to put them into a
folder called `lib`. Then you can launch your scripts like so:

[source,bash]
----
java -cp 'cljs.jar:lib/*:src' clojure.main build.clj
----

As your dependency graph becomes more sophisticated it may make sense to
rely on Maven or Leiningen to manage dependencies for you. Please refer
to <<xref/../../../reference/dependencies#,Dependencies>> for a comprehensive tutorial. What
follows is just the basics.

[[leiningen]]
=== Leiningen

All the commands above may be executed with the `run` feature of
Leiningen. With Leiningen you do not need to specify the classpath. For
example for a REPL you would do something like the following from your
project directory:

[source,bash]
----
lein run -m clojure.main repl.clj
----

One important thing to remember with Leiningen is the `:source-paths`
configuration parameter. The `:source-paths`, found in the project.clj,
are appended to the classpath. For a ClojureScript build you should
include all the source paths to your ClojureScript sources in the
`:source-paths` parameter. The path "src" is included by default.

This is especially important if you use another path besides "src".

If you have any questions about the classpath you can see it easily by
typing `lein classpath`.

[[maven]]
=== Maven

Same as Leiningen, you can use Maven to run the above scripts and you do
not need to specify the classpath. Add the `clojure-maven-plugin` to
your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<project xmlns="..."
         xsi:schemaLocation="....">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.theoryinpractise</groupId>
                <artifactId>clojure-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>1.7.1</version>
                <extensions>true</extensions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ...
</project>
----

Then you can start a repl with the `clojure:run` task:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clojure:run -Dclojure.script=repl.clj
----
