*This guide requires ClojureScript 1.10.741 or later and assumes
familiarity with the <<xref/../../guides/quick-start#,Quick Start>>*.

This page documents how to integrate ClojureScript with a typical JavaScript
bundler such as http://webpack.js.org[Webpack]. You should have
http://nodejs.org[Node.js] installed. This guide assumes you have read through the Quick
Start. This guide borrows liberally from this
https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel[excellent
guide on Webpack 2].

While we happen to use Webpack here, these instructions are easily adapted
to other bundlers like Metro for React Native.

[[setting-up]]
== Setting Up Your Project

First create a project directory:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir hello-bundler
cd hello-bundler
```

Create a `deps.edn` file the following contents:

[source,clojure]
```
{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.741"}}}
```

Create an empty `package.json` file:

[source,bash]
```
echo "{}" > package.json
```

Add webpack and its command line tools:
[source,bash]
```
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

Create a `webpack.config.js` file:

[source,javascript]
```
module.exports = {
  entry: './out/index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/out",
    filename: 'out/main.js'
  }
}
```

The bundler will use our ClojureScript output file as the entry. We'll write
the bundler result back into the output directory.

We're now ready to setup our JS dependencies.

[[javascript-dependencies]]
=== JavaScript Dependencies

Install react and react-dom:

[source,json]
```
npm install --save react react-dom
```

Now create `src/hello_bundler/core.cljs` with the following contents:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns hello-bundler.core
  (:require [react]))

(.log js/console react/Component)
```

Notice that we are requiring React as if it was a normal require and a normal
namespace.

In order for this to work we need to set a couple of compiler options. Create
a `build.edn` file with the following:

[source,clojure]
```
{:main hello-bundler.core
 :output-to "out/index.js"
 :output-dir "out"
 :target :bundle
 :bundle-cmd {:none ["npx" "webpack" "--mode=development"]
              :default ["npx" "webpack"]}}
```

Our build will generate `out/index.js` which is exactly the entry file that
Webpack is looking for.

Note the new `:target :bundle` option. This ensures that the generated code
is compatible with popular JavaScript bundlers that can handle Node.js style
`require`. It also sets a bunch of other sensible defaults like externs
inference, so that advanced compilation will just work. `:bundle-cmd` is just
an arbitrary shell command to run after the ClojureScript build completes.
In the case of watching bundlers like Metro you probably won't bother with
`:bundle-cmd`.

Let's see this in action, the following will build your project then start
a REPL:

[source,bash]
```
clj -m cljs.main -co build.edn -v -c -r
```

Your default browser will open http://localhost:9000. Open the Developer Console,
you should see that `React.Component` got logged.

At the REPL you can require `react` and interact with it:

[source, bash]
```
user> (require 'react)
```

[[overriding-foreign-lib]]
== Overriding a Foreign Library

You may find that you want to use React from `node_modules` perhaps because
the latest bundled version hasn't yet appeared on CLJSJS. Yet, you still want to
use some ClojureScript React binding like Reagent. ClojureScript supports this
out of the box.

To demonstrate this, change your `deps.edn` to the following:

[source,clojure]
```
{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.741"}
        reagent {:mvn/version "0.10.0" :exclusions [cljsjs/react cljsjs/react-dom]}}}
```

Change your source file to the following:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns hello-bundler.core
  (:require [goog.dom :as gdom]
            [reagent.dom :as dom]))

(defn simple-component []
  [:div
   [:p "I am a component!"]
   [:p.someclass
    "I have " [:strong "bold"]
    [:span {:style {:color "red"}} " and red "] "text."]])

(dom/render [simple-component] (gdom/getElement "app"))
```

Rebuild your project, run the REPL:

[source,bash]
```
clj -m cljs.main -co build.edn -v -c -r
```

To verify that externs inference allows advanced compilation to work,
let's make an advanced build. REPLs don't work under advanced compilation
so you'll have to manually open http://localhost:9000:

[source,bash]
```
clj -m cljs.main -co build.edn -O advanced -v -c -s
```

That's it!
