This page documents how to use http://webpack.js.org[Webpack] and externs
inference to easily integrate popular libraries from the JavaScript ecosystem
into your ClojureScript project. You should have http://nodejs.org[Node.js] and
http://yarnpkg.com[yarn] installed. This guide assumes you have read through the
Quick Start. This guide borrows liberally from this
https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel[excellent
guide on Webpack 2].

[[setting-up]]
== Setting Up Your Project

First create a project directory and initialize yarn:

[source,bash]
```
mkdir hello-webpack
cd hello-webpack
yarn init -y
```

Add webpack and its command line tools:

[source,bash]
```
yarn add webpack webpack-cli
```

Create a `webpack.config.js` file:

[source,javascript]
```
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/js/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  }
}
```

We're now ready to setup our JS dependencies:

[[javascript-dependencies]]
=== JavaScript Dependencies

Install react and react-dom:

[source,json]
```
yarn add react react-dom
```

Now we need to import and export them so that ClojureScript can use them. Create
`src/js/index.js` with the following content:

[source,json]
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
window.React = React;
window.ReactDOM = ReactDOM;
```

Modify your `package.json` to include the following `"scripts"` entry:

[source,json]
```
{
  // stuff ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack"
  }
  // stuff ...
}
```

Now build your foreign library!

[source,bash]
```
yarn build
```

You should now have a file in `dist/index_bundle.js`. Let's do the ClojureScript
bits now.

[[using-your-foreign-lib]]
== Using Your Foreign Library

Create a `deps.edn` file:

[source,clojure]
```
{:paths ["src/cljs"]
 :deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.308"}}}
```

Now create `src/cljs/hello_webpack/core.cljs` with the following contents:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns hello-webpack.core
  (:require [react]))

(.log js/console react/Component)
```

Notice that we are requiring React as if it was a normal require and a normal
namespace.

In order for this to work we need to set a couple of compiler options. Create
a `build.edn` file with the following:

[source,clojure]
```
{:main hello-webpack.core
 :output-to "out/main.js"
 :output-dir "out"
 :infer-externs true
 :npm-deps false
 :foreign-libs [{:file "dist/index_bundle.js"
                 :provides ["react" "react-dom"]
                 :global-exports {react React
                                  react-dom ReactDOM}}]}
```

We turn on externs inference and we disable reading from `node_modules` since
we're managing that on our own. We then state what our foreign lib provides
and what global JavaScript variables will have the library objects. This is why
we exported to `window` in `index.js`. Note that our foreign library can provide
as many libraries as we like and we can define exactly where they will be found.
This also allows us to use foreign libraries as if they were normal
ClojureScript namespaces. However, ClojureScript knows these are foreign libraries
and will treat any function calls and property accesses as things to be considered
for externing.

Let's see this in action.

[source,bash]
```
clj -m cljs.main -co build.edn -v -c
```

Let's verify that it worked:

[source,bash]
```
clj -m cljs.main -s
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:9000. Open the Developer Console, you
should see that `React.Component` got logged.

Check `out/inferred_externs.js`. You should see that `Object.Component` was
inferred.

[[overriding-foreign-lib]]
== Overriding a Foreign Library

Occasionally you may find that you need to provide a custom build of React but
you still want to use some ClojureScript React binding like Reagent.
ClojureScript supports this out of the box.

To demonstrate this change your `deps.edn` to the following:

[source,clojure]
```
{:paths ["src/cljs"]
 :deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.309"}
        reagent {:mvn/version "0.8.1" :exclusions [cljsjs/react]}}}
```

Change your source file to following:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns hello-webpack.core
  (:require [goog.dom :as gdom]
            [reagent.core :as r]))

(defn simple-component []
  [:div
   [:p "I am a component!"]
   [:p.someclass
    "I have " [:strong "bold"]
    [:span {:style {:color "red"}} " and red "] "text."]])

(r/render [simple-component] (gdom/getElement "app"))
```

Rebuild your project, run the webserver and open http://localhost:9000:

[source,bash]
```
clj -m cljs.main -co build.edn -v -c -s
```

To verify that externs inference allows advanced compilation to work,
let's make an advanced build:

[source,bash]
```
clj -m cljs.main -co build.edn -O advanced -v -c -s
```
