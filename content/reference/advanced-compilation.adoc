If you are targeting traditional JavaScript clients (web browsers) it's
important to think about advanced compilation from the very beginning.
Otherwise you will inevitably find yourself going through issues that
could have been easily avoided with a little bit of up front
preparation. In general do not wait to try an advanced build, you should
always periodically generate a production build to catch issues sooner.

== Avoid Foreign Libraries

It's best to simply avoid foreign libraries if a solution exists either
in Google Closure Library or in an existing ClojureScript library.
Foreign libraries must supply externs for advanced compilation to work
consistently.

Of course, in some cases foreign libraries cannot be avoided.

[[using-foreign-libraries]]
== Using Foreign Libraries

If you must use a foreign library use a curated one like those provided
by http://cljsjs.github.io[CLJSJS]. These come packaged with externs so
that you do not have to supply them yourself.

Occasionally you may find yourself needing a foreign library which has
not been prepackaged.

[[providing-externs]]
== Providing externs

When working with a foreign library which does not supply externs take
the time to write an externs file for the API you intend to use. Externs
files are surprisingly simple to provide. For example if the foreign
library has some property `Foo.bar` that you wish to access your externs
file should have the following entry:

....
Foo.bar;
....

If the foreign library has some method `Foo.baz` that you wish to invoke
your externs file should have the following entry:

....
Foo.baz = function() {};
....

Sometimes there will not be a top level API but rather some method
naming convention, that is, an ad-hoc Interface / Protocol. In these
cases define your externs using Object:

....
Object.foo = function() {};
Object.bar = function() {};
....

Of course sometimes you will miss an extern entry and the the production
file will produce a cryptic error. Thanks to a couple of Closure
compiler options these issues are no longer difficult to debug.

[[access-from-javascript]]
== Access from JavaScript

If you'd like to access ClojureScript code from JavaScript, then you
will need to cope with the fact that advanced compilation will munge
the JavaScript representation of
your Var names. This can be easily addressed by adding `:export` metadata
to Vars that should be consumable from JavaScript.

For example, if you have a `square` function, you can annotate it with
`^:export` as follows:

[source,clojure]
```
(ns my-math.core)

(defn ^:export square [x]
  (* x x))
```

With this, you can call your `square` function from JavaScript as follows:

[source,javascript]
```
my_math.core.square(3);
```

This works by including https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.html#exportSymbol[`goog.exportSymbol`] 
calls in the emitted JavaScript wherever `:export` meta is associated 
with a Var.

[NOTE]
====
For each exported Var, an additional un-renamed alias is established which points to the Closure-munged name. 
Munged names continue to be used internally within the optimized code.

The `^:export` facility is for (and only for) providing external access to Vars via un-renamed aliases. 
If instead you'd like to debug optimized code which is using shortened names, consider `:pseudo-names` and `:pretty-print`, which are described in the following section.
====

You can individually export the Vars associated with protocol methods. In this example, `bar` and `quux` will be exported:

[source,clojure]
```
(defprotocol IFoo
  (^:export bar [this])
  (baz [this x])
  (^:export quux [this x y]))
```  

[[fixing-advanced-compilation-issues]]
== Fixing Advanced Compilation Issues

Change your production build to use two additional options
`:pseudo-names true` and `:pretty-print true`. Now your error will show
a name that corresponds to the name in the original source. Add an
externs entry for this missed case.

option syntax consult <<dependencies#,dependencies>>.
