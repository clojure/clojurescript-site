Here is the list of compiler options that can be passed to the
ClojureScript compiler.

[[common-options]]
== Common Options

[[output-to]]
=== :output-to

The path to the JavaScript file that will be output.

[source,clojure]
----
:output-to "resources/public/js/main.js"
----

[[output-dir]]
=== :output-dir

Sets the output directory for temporary files used during compilation.
Defaults to "out".

[source,clojure]
----
:output-dir "resources/public/js/out"
----

[[optimizations]]
=== :optimizations

The optimization level. May be `:none`, `:whitespace`, `:simple`, or
`:advanced`. Only `:none` and `:simple` are supported for bootstrapped
ClojureScript.

`:none` is the recommended setting for development, while `:advanced` is
the recommended setting for production, unless something prevents it
(incompatible external library, bug, etc.).

For a detailed explanation of the different optimization modes see
https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels[Closure
Compiler Compilation Levels].

The https://github.com/dcodeIO/node.js-closure-compiler-externs[node.js
externs] may also serve as useful examples.

When the <<compiler-options#main,`:main` option>> is not used, `:none` requires manual code loading and hence a separate HTML from the other options.

Defaults to `:none`. Note: `lein cljsbuild` `1.0.5` will supply
`:whitespace`. (See
https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild/issues/381[this issue].)

[source,clojure]
----
:optimizations :none
----

[[main]]
=== :main

Specifies an entry point namespace. When combined with optimization
level `:none`, `:main` will cause the compiler to emit a single
JavaScript file that will import **goog/base.js**, the JavaScript file
for the namespace, and emit the required `goog.require` statement. This
permits leaving HTML markup identical between dev and production.

[source,clojure]
----
:main "foo.bar"
----

Also see `:asset-path`.

[NOTE]
====
Note: This will result in the main namespace, along with the transitive
closure of all ``:require``d namespaces to be loaded into your JavaScript
environment. If you have other non-referenced namespaces that need to be
loaded, consider either ``:require``ing them or manually loading them by
issuing the appropriate additional `goog.require` statements.
====

[[asset-path]]
=== :asset-path

When using `:main` it is often necessary to control where the entry
point script attempts to load scripts from due to the configuration of
the web server. `:asset-path` is a relative URL path not a file system
path. For example, if your output directory is
`:output-dir "resources/public/js/compiled/out"` but your webserver is
serving files from `"resources/public"` then you want the entry point
script to load scripts from "js/compiled/out".

[source,clojure]
----
:asset-path "js/compiled/out"
----

[[source-map]]
=== :source-map

See <<source-maps#,Source-maps>>. Under
optimizations `:none` the valid values are `true` and `false`, with the
default being `true`. Under all other optimization settings must specify
a path to where the source map will be written.

Under `:none`:

[source,clojure]
----
:source-map false
----

Otherwise:

[source,clojure]
----
:source-map "path/to/source/map.js.map"
----

[[verbose]]
=== :verbose

Emit details and measurements from compiler activity.

[source,clojure]
----
:verbose true
----

[[pretty-print]]
=== :pretty-print

Determines whether the JavaScript output will be tabulated in a
human-readable manner. Defaults to true.

[source,clojure]
----
:pretty-print false
----

[[target]]
=== :target

If targeting nodejs add this line. Takes no other options at the moment.
The default (no `:target` specified) implies browsers are being
targeted. Have a look <<xref/../../../guides/quick-start#running-clojurescript-on-nodejs,here>> for more information on how to run your code in nodejs.

[source,clojure]
----
:target :nodejs
----

[[foreign-libs]]
=== :foreign-libs

Adds dependencies on foreign libraries. Be sure that the url returns a
HTTP Code 200.

Defaults to the empty vector `[]`

[source,clojure]
----
:foreign-libs [{ :file "http://example.com/remote.js"
                 :provides  ["my.example"]
                 :global-exports '{my.example MyExample}
               { :file "./resources/js/local.js"
                 :provides ["my.other.example"]}
               { :file "./path/to/directory/"
                 ;; :provides will be automatically generated based on
                 ;; each .js filename. E.g: your.dep.js file will
                 ;; provides ["your.dep"]. Custom defined :provides in
                 ;; this case will be overwritten.
                }]
----

Each element in the `:foreign-libs` vector should be a map, where the
keys have these semantics:

* `:file` Indicates the URL to the library. This can be either local
path or remote url to the dependency file. If local path is a
directory instead of a file, the compiler will recursively go through
all `.js` files within the directory and automatically assign a
`:provides` values based on the `.js` filename. E.g: `your.js.deps.js`
results in computed `:provides` `["your.js.deps"]`, and your custom
`:provides` will be overwritten by the generated `:provides`.
* `:file-min` (Optional) Indicates the URL to the minified variant of
the library.
* `:provides` A synthetic namespace that is associated with the library.
This is typically a vector with a single string, but it has the
capability of specifying multiple namespaces (typically used only by
Google Closure libraries).
* `:requires` (Optional) A vector explicitly identifying dependencies
(`:provides` values from other foreign libs); used to form a topological
sort honoring dependencies.
* `:module-type` (Optional) indicates that the foreign lib uses a given
module system. Can be one of `:commonjs`, `:amd`, `:es6`. Note that if
supplied, `:requires` is not used (as it is implicitly determined). For more info see <<xref/../javascript-module-support#,JavaScript Module Support (Alpha)>>.
* `:preprocess` (Optional) Used to preprocess / transform code in other
dialects (JSX, etc.). The value can be either a symbol or a keyword.
If symbol is provided, it should resolve to a function that takes two
parameters: js-module and options maps. Compiler will require the
namespace to which the symbol refers if it is not yet loaded.
If value is keyword, it is used as dispatch value for `cljs.clojure/js-transforms`
multimethod. For more info see <<xref/../javascript-library-preprocessing#,JavaScript Library Preprocessing>>.
* `:global-exports` (Optional) used to map provided namespaces to globally
exported values. If present the foreign library can be used idiomatically
when required, i.e. support for `:refer`, `:rename`, `:as`, etc.

[[externs]]
=== :externs

Configure externs files for external libraries.

For this option, and those below, you can find a very good explanation
at:
http://lukevanderhart.com/2011/09/30/using-javascript-and-clojurescript.html

Defaults to the empty vector `[]`.

[source,clojure]
----
:externs ["jquery-externs.js"]
----

[[modules]]
=== :modules

A new option for emitting Google Closure Modules. Closure Modules
supports splitting up an optimized build into N different modules. If
`:modules` is supplied it replaces the single `:output-to`. A module
needs a name, an individual `:output-to` file path, `:entries` a set of
namespaces, and `:depends-on` a set of modules on which the module
depends. Modules are only supported with `:simple` and `:advanced`
optimizations. An example follows:

[source,clojure]
----
{:optimizations :advanced
 :source-map true
 :output-dir "resources/public/js"
 :modules {
   :common
     {:output-to "resources/public/js/common.js"
      :entries #{"com.foo.common"}}
   :landing
     {:output-to "resources/public/js/landing.js"
      :entries #{"com.foo.landing"}
      :depends-on #{:common}}
   :editor
     {:output-to "resources/public/js/editor.js"
      :entries #{"com.foo.editor"}
      :depends-on #{:common}}}}
----

Any namespaces not in an `:entries` set will be moved into the default
module `:cljs-base`. However thanks to cross module code motion, Google
Closure can move functions and methods into the modules where they are
actually used. This process is somewhat conservative so if you know that
you want to keep some code together do this via `:entries`.

The `:cljs-base` module defaults to being written out to `:output-dir`
with the name "cljs_base.js". This may be overridden by specifying a
`:cljs-base` module describing _only_ `:output-to`.

Take careful note that a namespace may only appear once across all
module `:entries`.

`:modules` fully supports `:foreign-libs`. `:foreign-libs` are always
put into dependency order before any Google Closure compiled source.

Source maps are fully supported, an individual one will be created for
each module. Just supply `:source-map true` (see example) as there is no
single source map to name.

[[preloads]]
=== :preloads

Developing ClojureScript commonly requires development time only side
effects such as enabling printing, logging, spec instrumentation, and
connecting REPLs. `:preloads` permits loading such side effect
boilerplate right after `cljs.core`. For example you can make a
development namespace for enabling printing in browsers:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns foo.dev)

(enable-console-print!)
----

Now you can configure your development build to load this side effect
prior to your main namespace with the following compiler options:

[source,clojure]
----
{:preloads '[foo.dev]
 :main 'foo.core
 :output-dir "out"}
----

`:preloads` must be a sequence of symbols that map to existing
namespaces discoverable on the classpath. Note the leading quote is not
necessary when using Leiningen - values in `project.clj` are implicitly
quoted.

[[npm-deps]]
=== :npm-deps

Declare NPM dependencies. A map of NPM package names to the desired versions.
Used to install NPM dependencies on behalf of the user. See also `:install-deps`.

[source,clojure]
---
{:npm-deps {"lodash" "4.17.4}}
---

[[install-deps]]
=== :install-deps

If `true` automatically install all declared `:npm-deps` including those
declared in upstream dependencies.

[[checked-arrays]]
=== :checked-arrays

If set to `:warn` or `:error`, checks inferred types and runtime values
passed to `aget` and `aset`. Inferred type mismatches will result in
the `:invalid-array-access` warning being triggered. Logs when incorrect
values are passed if set to `:warn`, throws if set to `:error`. May be
set to a `false`-y value to disable this feature.

This setting does not apply if `:optimizations` is set to `:advanced`.

[source,clojure]
----
:checked-arrays :warn
----

[[less-common-options]]
== Less Common Options

[[source-map-path]]
=== :source-map-path

Set the path to source files references in source maps to avoid further
web server configuration.

[source,clojure]
----
:source-map-path "public/js"
----

This option affects the `sources` entry of the emitted source map V3
JSON file.

[[source-map-asset-path]]
=== :source-map-asset-path

Provides fine grained control over the `sourceMappingURL` comment that
is appended to generated JavaScript files when source mapping is
enabled.

[source,clojure]
----
:source-map-asset-path "http://foo.com/public/js/out"
----

[[source-map-timestamp]]
=== :source-map-timestamp

Add cache busting timestamps to source map urls. This is helpful for
keeping source maps up to date when live reloading code.

[source,clojure]
----
:source-map-timestamp true
----

[[cache-analysis]]
=== :cache-analysis

Experimental. Cache compiler analysis to disk. This enables faster cold
build and REPL start up times.

For REPLs, defaults to `true`. Otherwise, defaults to `true` if and only
if `:optimizations` is `:none`.

[source,clojure]
----
:cache-analysis true
----

[[recompile-dependents]]
=== :recompile-dependents

For correctness the ClojureScript compiler now always recompiles
dependent namespaces when a parent namespace changes. This prevents
corrupted builds and swallowed warnings. However this can impact compile
times depending on the structure of the application. This option
defaults to `true`.

[source,clojure]
----
:recompile-dependents false
----

[[static-fns]]
=== :static-fns

Employs static dispatch to specific function arities in emitted
JavaScript, as opposed to making use of the `call` construct. Defaults
to false except under advanced optimizations. Useful to have set to
false at REPL development to facilitate function redefinition, and
useful to set to true for release for performance.

This setting does not apply to the standard library, which is always
compiled with `:static-fns` implicitly set to true.

[source,clojure]
----
:static-fns true
----

[[fn-invoke-direct]]
=== :fn-invoke-direct

Requires `:static-fns true`.
This option emits slightly different code that can speed up your code
around 10-30%. Higher order function that don't implement the `IFn` protocol 
are normally called with `f.call(null, arg0, arg1 ...)`. With this option
enabled the compiler calls them with a faster `f(arg0, arg1 ...` instead.

[source,clojure]
----
:fn-invoke-direct true
----

[[warnings]]
=== :warnings

This flag will turn on/off compiler warnings for references to
undeclared vars, wrong function call arities, etc. Can be a boolean for
enabling/disabling common warnings, or a map of specific warning keys
with associated booleans. Defaults to true.

[source,clojure]
----
:warnings true
;; OR
:warnings {:fn-deprecated false} ;; suppress this warning
----

The following warnings are supported:

* `:preamble-missing`, missing preamble
* `:unprovided`, required namespace not provided
* `:undeclared-var`, undeclared var
* `:undeclared-ns`, var references non-existent namespace
* `:undeclared-ns-form`, namespace reference in ns form that does not
exist
* `:redef`, var redefinition
* `:dynamic`, dynamic binding of non-dynamic var
* `:fn-var`, var previously bound to fn changed to different type
* `:fn-arity`, invalid invoke arity
* `:fn-deprecated`, deprecated function usage
* `:protocol-deprecated`, deprecated protocol usage
* `:undeclared-protocol-symbol`, undeclared protocol referred
* `:invalid-protocol-symbol`, invalid protocol symbol
* `:multiple-variadic-overloads`, multiple variadic arities
* `:variadic-max-arity`, arity greater than variadic arity
* `:overload-arity`, duplicate arities
* `:extending-base-js-type`, JavaScript base type extension
* `:invoke-ctor`, type constructor invoked as function
* `:invalid-arithmetic`, invalid arithmetic
* `:invalid-array-access`, invalid use of `aget` or `aset`
* `:protocol-invalid-method`, protocol method does not match declaration
* `:protocol-duped-method`, duplicate protocol method implementation
* `:protocol-multiple-impls`, protocol implemented multiple times
* `:protocol-with-variadic-method`, protocol declares variadic signature
* `:protocol-impl-with-variadic-method`, protocol impl employs variadic signature
* `:protocol-impl-recur-with-target`, target passed in recur to protocol method head
* `:single-segment-namespace`, single segment namespace
* `:munged-namespace`, namespace name contains a reserved JavaScript keyword
* `:ns-var-clash`, namespace clashes with var
* `:extend-type-invalid-method-shape`, method arities must be grouped together
* `:unsupported-js-module-type`, unsupported JavaScript module type
* `:unsupported-preprocess-value`, unsupported foreign lib preprocess value
* `:js-shadowed-by-local`, name shadowed by a local
* `:infer-warning`, warnings related to externs inference

[[elide-asserts]]
=== :elide-asserts

This flag will cause all `(assert` _x_ `)` calls to be removed during
compilation, including implicit ``assert``s associated with `:pre` and
`:post` conditions. Useful for production. Default is always false even
in advanced compilation. Does NOT specify `goog.asserts.ENABLE_ASSERTS`,
which is different and used by the Closure library.

[NOTE]
====
Note that, with JVM ClojureScript, it is not possible to dynamically set
`pass:[*assert*]` to false at runtime; this compiler flag must explicitly be
used to effect the elision. With self-hosted ClojureScript, on the other
hand, setting `pass:[*assert*]` will cause `asserts` to be elided as in
Clojure.
====

[source,clojure]
----
:elide-asserts true
----

[[pseudo-names]]
=== :pseudo-names

With `:advanced` mode optimizations, determines whether readable names
are emitted. This can be useful when debugging issues in the optimized
JavaScript and can aid in finding missing <<compiler-options#externs,externs>>.
Defaults to false.

[source,clojure]
----
:pseudo-names true
----

[[print-input-delimiter]]
=== :print-input-delimiter

Determines whether comments will be output in the JavaScript that can be
used to determine the original source of the compiled code.

Defaults to false.

[source,clojure]
----
:print-input-delimiter false
----

[[output-wrapper]]
=== :output-wrapper

Wrap the JavaScript output in `(function(){...};)()` to avoid clobbering
globals. Defaults to false.

[source,clojure]
----
:output-wrapper false
----

[[libs]]
=== :libs

BROKEN. DO NOT USE. SEE: https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJS-1559

Adds dependencies on external js libraries, i.e. Google
Closure-compatible javascript files with correct `goog.provides()` and
`goog.requires()` calls. Note that files in these directories will be
watched and a rebuild will occur if they are modified.

Paths or filenames can be given. Relative paths are relative to the
current working directory (usually project root).

Defaults to the empty vector `[]`

[source,clojure]
----
:libs ["closure/library/third_party/closure"
       "src/js"
       "src/org/example/example.js"]
----

[[preamble]]
=== :preamble

Prepends the contents of the given files to each output file. Only valid
with optimizations other than `:none`.

Defaults to the empty vector `[]`

[source,clojure]
----
:preamble ["license.js"]
----

[[hashbang]]
=== :hashbang

When using `:target :nodejs` the compiler will emit a shebang as the
first line of the compiled source, making it executable. When your
intention is to build a node.js module, instead of executable, use this
option to remove the shebang.

[source,clojure]
----
:hashbang false
----

[[compiler-stats]]
=== :compiler-stats

Report basic timing measurements on compiler activity.

Defaults to `false`.

[source,clojure]
----
:compiler-stats true
----

[[language-in-and-language-out]]
=== :language-in and :language-out

Configure the input and output languages for the closure library. May be:

* `:ecmascript6` identical to `:es6`
* `:ecmascript6-strict` identical to `:es6-strict`
* `:ecmascript6-typed` identical to `:es6-typed`
* `:ecmascript5` identical to `:es5`
* `:ecmascript5-strict` identical to `:es5-strict`
* `:ecmascript3` identical to `:es3`
* `:no-transpile`

Defaults to `:ecmascript3`

[source,clojure]
----
:language-in  :ecmascript3
:language-out :ecmascript3
----

[[closure-output-charset]]
=== :closure-output-charset

Configure the output character set. May be:

* `iso-8859-1`
* `us-ascii`
* `utf-16`
* `utf-16be`
* `utf-16le`
* `utf-8`

Defaults to `utf-8`

[source,clojure]
----
:closure-output-charset "iso-8859-1"
----

[[rewrite-polyfills]]
=== :rewrite-polyfills

If set to true, the google closure compiler will add polyfills
(for example when you use native javascript `Promise`).
*This requires `:language-in` to be set to `:es6` or higher or it will
silently be ignored!*

[source,clojure]
----
:language-in  :es6
:rewrite-polyfills true
----

[[closure-warnings]]
=== :closure-warnings

Configure warnings generated by the Closure compiler. A map from Closure
warning to configuration value, only `:error`, `:warning` and `:off` are
supported.

[source,clojure]
----
:closure-warnings {:externs-validation :off}
----

The following Closure warning options are exposed to ClojureScript:

[source,clojure]
----
:access-controls
:ambiguous-function-decl
:analyzer-checks
:check-eventful-object-disposal
:check-regexp
:check-types
:check-useless-code

:violated-module-dep
:visiblity
----

See the https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Warnings[Closure
Compiler Warning wiki] for detailed descriptions.

[[closure-defines]]
=== :closure-defines

Set the values of Closure libraries' variables annotated with
https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler#tag-define[@define]
or with the `cljs.core/goog-define` helper macro. A common usage is
setting `goog.DEBUG` to false:

[source,clojure]
----
:closure-defines {"goog.DEBUG" false}
----

or

[source,clojure]
----
:closure-defines {'goog.DEBUG false}
----

Note when using Lein the quote is unnecessary due to implicit quoting.

For `:optimization :none`, a `:main` option must be specified for
defines to work, and only `goog-define` defines are affected.
`:closure-defines` currently does not have any effect with
`:optimization :whitespace`.

You can use the variables set in `:closure-defines` to eliminate parts
of your code at compile time (DCE). However, to do so you must use `if`
or `cond` in combination with an `identical?` comparison. Any other
forms (such as `case` or `condp`) will work correctly at runtime, but
the javascript output will contain the dead code branches.

For example, if you want to make a localized build of your application
which only contains the translation messages relevant for the locale:

[source,clojure]
----
(def messages
  (cond
    (identical? js/goog.LOCALE "nl") i18n.nl/messages
    (identical? js/goog.LOCALE "fr") i18n.fr/messages
    :else i18n.en/messages))
----

[[closure-extra-annotations]]
=== :closure-extra-annotations

Define extra JSDoc annotations that a closure library might use so that
they don't trigger compiler warnings.

[source,clojure]
----
:closure-extra-annotations #{"api"}
----

[[anon-fn-naming-policy]]
=== :anon-fn-naming-policy

Strategies for how the Google Closure compiler does naming of anonymous
functions that occur as r-values in assignments and variable
declarations. Defaults to `:off`.

[source,clojure]
----
:anon-fn-naming-policy :unmapped
----

The following values are supported:

* `:off` Don't give anonymous functions names.
* `:unmapped` Generates names that are based on the left-hand side of
the assignment. Runs after variable and property renaming, so that the
generated names will be short and obfuscated.
* `:mapped` Generates short unique names and provides a mapping from
them back to a more meaningful name that's based on the left-hand side
of the assignment.

[[optimize-constants]]
=== :optimize-constants

When set to `true`, constants, such as keywords and symbols, will only
be created once and will be written to a separate file
(`cljs/core/constants.js`). The compiler will emit a reference to the constant
as defined in the constants table instead of creating a new object for
it. This option is mainly intended to be used for a release build since
it can increase performance due to decreased allocation. Defaults to
`true` under `:advanced` optimizations otherwise to `false`.

[source,clojure]
----
:optimize-constants true
----

[[parallel-build]]
=== :parallel-build

When set to `true`, compile source in parallel, utilizing multiple
cores.

[source,clojure]
----
:parallel-build true
----

[[watch-fn]]
=== :watch-fn

Is a function that will be called after a successful build.

*Only available for `cljs.build.api/watch`*

[source,clojure]
----
:watch-fn (fn [] (println "Updated build"))
----

[[process-shim]]
=== :process-shim

Defaults to `true`. Automatically provide a shim for Node.js `process.env`
containing a single Google Closure define, `NODE_ENV` with `"development"`
as the default value. In production `NODE_ENV` will be set to `"production"`.
If set to `false` all of the stated behavior is disabled.
